# qrcodify-ios
iOS client app generate QRCode image from text or URL content. It supports share extension so you can share such content to qrcodify, open the app then finall found your generated QRCode image.

This project works with [QRCoderly](https://github.com/haxpor/qrcoderly-macos) on macOS for it to consume your QRCode image. So you can open URL on desktop's browser quickly as you found such link on mobile, or the case when you want a text found on mobile app and use it on desktop.

Whole process is offline. This means there is no Internet connection needed for QRCoderly to consume QRCode image generated from QRCodify. This will suit users that need a quick and normal way to transfer text/URL between mobile and desktop.
